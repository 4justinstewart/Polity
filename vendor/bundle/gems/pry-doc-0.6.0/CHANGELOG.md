### v0.6.0 (March 8, 2014)

* Rescanned docs for Ruby 2.1
* Removed the gem certificate

### v0.5.1 (December 26, 2013)

* **Important:** previous version `v0.5.0` does _not_ support Ruby 2.1.0. This
  version does!

### v0.5.0 (December 25, 2013)

### v0.4.6 (May 19, 2013)

* Added new docs for Ruby 1.9 and Ruby 2.0. For example, now you can execute
  `show-doc BigDecimal` and feel a little bit more happy.

  top-level methods `include`, `private`, `public`, etc.)
